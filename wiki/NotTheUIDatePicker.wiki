#summary Explaining that this project is NOT the jQuery UI datepicker
= This googlecode project is not for the jQuery UI datepicker =

The datepicker described on these pages is one created by me (Kelvin Luck) before the jQuery UI project (or datepicker) existed. It is a completely different piece of code with it's own strengths and weaknesses as compared to the UI datepicker. 

The name causes a fair amount of confusion which this page is intended to help clear up. 

If you are looking for the jQuery UI datepicker you can find it here:

http://jqueryui.com/

You can find their documentation here:

http://docs.jquery.com/UI/Datepicker

If you are interested in my date picker you can find all of the code here on googlecode in SVN. You can also see all of the latest demos and documentation here:
